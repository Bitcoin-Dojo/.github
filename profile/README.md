# ü•ã Bitcoin Dojo 

Welcome to **Bitcoin Dojo** ‚Äî a hands-on learning space for Bitcoin developers.  
Here, you level up your skills by solving real coding challenges that build actual Bitcoin infrastructure from scratch.

Whether you're curious about cryptography, transactions, or script, Bitcoin Dojo helps you go from zero to protocol-level understanding, by building your own Bitcoin utility library from scratch.

## üß≠ Mission

Our mission is to **teach Bitcoin by building it**.

No black boxes. No shortcuts. You‚Äôll implement real Bitcoin internals in Rust ‚Äî including:
- Elliptic curve cryptography
- Address encoding
- Transactions
- Script evaluation
- Blocks
- P2P network messages

Each challenge is designed to deepen your understanding of how Bitcoin works **under the hood**.

## üìö Tracks

Bitcoin Dojo is organized into learning tracks:

| Track | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Cryptography Fundamentals` | Field arithmetic, elliptic curves, digital signatures ‚Äî everything needed to understand Bitcoin's public key cryptography. |
| `Addresses and Encoding` | Learn about Bitcoin primitives including SEC, DER, base58, and WIF. |
| `Transactions` | Parse, and serialize Bitcoin transactions. Examine the anatomy of a transaction, including inputs, outputs, and signatures. |
| _Upcoming_ | `Script`, `Blocks`, `P2P and Networking` ‚Äî and more. |
